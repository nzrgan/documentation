                React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
                app
                platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                well as
                to
                describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="cursive">bundles of
                  reusable, nestable code</span>.
                You
                can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React
                Native.

                React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for building
                user
                interfaces with JavaScript. To make
                the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
                serve
                as
                a
                refresher course.
                We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React: <br>
                <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                friendly,
                approachable creatures
                that need names and a cafe to work in. <br>
                <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                JavaScript like so:
                <span class="color">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
                The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn
                even
                more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
                you
                can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="color">name</span> for the cat, name,
                and
                embedding it with curly braces
                inside <span class="color">&lt;Text&gt;</span><br>
                <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. <br>
                <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                render, state is like a
                component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                comes
                from
                user interaction. State gives your components memory!

          </section>

          <section id="handling-text">
            <hr>
            <div class="title">
              <div class="sup">
                <h2>handling text input</h2>
                <sup>Chapter 4</sup>
              </div>
              <p>
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                  class="cursive">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
                function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                be
                called when the text is submitted.
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                In
                this
                new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                translated as "üçï üçï".
